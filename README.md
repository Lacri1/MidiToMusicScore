MidiToMusicScore is a web application that takes MIDI files and converts them into sheet music.
The main goal of this project is to visualize digital music data (MIDI) in a human-readable form and allow users to download the generated sheet music as a PDF.

It supports uploading and parsing MIDI files, and displays the converted result.

This is a full-stack application built with Vue 3 on the frontend and Node.js with Express on the backend. The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful APIs using Axios, enabling file uploads and MIDI-to-PDF conversion.
